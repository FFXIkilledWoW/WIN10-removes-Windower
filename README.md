# WIN10-removes-Windower
"... Incompatibity with 64-bit versions of Windows ..." OR "Unsupported 16-bit Application" error pops up after one use.  I had to install Windower multiple times but never had issues like this before yesterday. The app was working smoothly all through November 2016 to Jan 2017. This feels like an apocolypse for me.
